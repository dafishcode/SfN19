					<strong><em>[Left]</em></strong> Networks of coupled neural masses are fitted to 1 minute worth of data recorded from 4 minutes after the light exposure (to capture steady state responses). These fitted models capture key differences between the phenotypes.

					<strong><em>[Right and Center Bottom]</em></strong> To assess whether the main deviations of the two mutant genotypes from wildtypes between conditions can be explained with subsets of parameters, we compared combinations of models across two model families - one <em>(right)</em> where parameters only vary in restricted parts of the anatomy; and one <em>(bottom)</em> where only some aspects of local inhibition are altered by the mutations.

					<strong><em>[Center Top]</em></strong> This graph shows the Bayesian model comparison across reduced models that best explain the effects of mutation on steady state power spectra for the two mutations separately. <br />
					For <em>gabra1 -/-</em>, Bayesian model comparison indicates, that changes across all anatomical brain regions are required, but that those changes can be restricted to alterations in between-population inhibitory coupling. For <em>gabrg2 -/-</em>, on the other hand, changes in all types of inhibitory coupling parameters are required, but these can be restricted to only the brain stem nodes. <br />
					These findings indicate that there are differential impairments in inhibitory neurotransmission between fish, which we will explore further in future studies.
