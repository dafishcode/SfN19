					<strong><em>[NMF Analysis]</em></strong> Using a sliding window approach, we can identify time-varying functional connectivity, using simple correlation across the anatomical regions estimated within each time window. <br />
					We can then concatenate unique edges over time into a <em>n</em> by <em>k</em> array, where <em>n</em> is the number of unique edges and <em>k</em> the number of time windows sampled. Using sparsity constrained non-negative matrix factorisation, we can decompose the full set of connectivity edges into variably expressed subnetworks, and their time varying expression profiles.
